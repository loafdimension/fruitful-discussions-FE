# About 📝

**To be noted!**

- I am yet to complete this project and have things in the [issues](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-FE/issues) to action so please bear that in mind!
- You are welcome to check out the [Future Features](#future-features) section to see what I have planned.

**What is Fruitful Discussions?**

- Fruitful Discussions is a project I completed during the Northcoders bootcamp. It is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Fruitful Discussions has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. It uses the seeded databases and API which was built in Fruitful Discussions BE.

**Key functionalities include:**

- **Article Browse:** Users can view articles divided into various topics.
- **User-Curated Ratings:** Articles feature upvote and downvote functionality, leveraging the back-end API.
- **Commenting System:** Users can add comments to articles and delete their own comments.

Fruitful Discussions uses data from the [Fruitful Discussions BE API](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-BE), which handles built the API, and handles any requests to it.
