# About üìù

**To be noted!**

- I am yet to complete this project and have things in the [Issues](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-FE/issues) to action so please bear that in mind!
- You are welcome to check out the [Future Features](#future-features) section to see what I have planned.

**What is Fruitful Discussions?**

- Fruitful Discussions is a project I completed during the Northcoders bootcamp. It is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Fruitful Discussions has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. It uses the seeded databases and API which was built in [Fruitful Discussions BE](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-BE).

**Key functionalities include:**

- **Article Browse:** Users can view articles divided into various topics.
- **User-Curated Ratings:** Articles feature upvote and downvote functionality, leveraging the back-end API.
- **Commenting System:** Users can add comments to articles and delete their own comments.

Fruitful Discussions uses data from the [Fruitful Discussions BE API](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-BE), which handles built the API, and handles any requests to it.
